# Command reference

```sh
Usage: mago analyze [OPTIONS] [PATHS]...
```

`mago analyse` is an alias for `mago analyze`. Both work.

Global flags must come before `analyze`. See the [CLI overview](/fundamentals/command-line-interface/) for the global list.

## Arguments

| Argument | Description |
| :--- | :--- |
| `[PATHS]...` | Files or directories to analyze. When provided, these replace the `paths` from `mago.toml` for this run. |

## Analyzer-specific options

| Flag | Description |
| :--- | :--- |
| `--no-stubs` | Skip the built-in PHP standard-library stubs. Use only when you have a reason. |
| `--skip-ignores` | Ignore the `ignore` list from `mago.toml` and report every issue found. Inline suppressions still apply. |
| `--staged` | Analyze only files staged in git. Fails outside a git repository. |
| `--stdin-input` | Read file content from stdin and use the single path argument for baseline lookup and reporting. Intended for editor integrations. |
| `--substitute <ORIG=TEMP>` | Replace one host file with another for this invocation. Intended for mutation testing. Repeatable. |
| `--watch` | Run continuously, re-analysing on file changes. See [watch mode](#watch-mode). |
| `--list-codes` | List every analyzer issue code as JSON. |
| `--scan-only` | Build the codebase and run the extensions' before-analysis hooks, then analyze no file. Reports only the issues those hooks raise, without the baseline. |
| `-h`, `--help` | Print help and exit. |

The shared flags for reporting, fixing, and baselines are documented on the [reporting and fixing options](/fundamentals/shared-reporting-options/) page.

## Reading from stdin

For editor and IDE integrations that pipe unsaved buffer content:

```sh
cat src/Example.php | mago analyze --stdin-input src/Example.php
```

Exactly one path argument is required. It is used as the logical (workspace-relative) file name for baseline matching and diagnostics. The path is normalised, so `./src/Example.php` is treated the same as `src/Example.php`. Conflicts with `--staged` and `--watch`.

## Substituting files

`--substitute ORIG=TEMP` replaces one host file with another for the duration of a single run without writing anything to disk. Designed for mutation-testing frameworks (Infection and friends) that produce a mutated copy of a source file and want the analyzer to evaluate the mutation against the rest of the project. If the analyzer reports a new error on the mutated file, the mutation can be killed without running the test suite.

```sh
mago analyze --substitute /abs/path/to/src/Foo.php=/tmp/mutation-42.php
```

Rules:

- Both `ORIG` and `TEMP` must be absolute paths and both files must exist.
- `ORIG` must be a host file under one of your configured `paths`. Vendored or excluded files cannot be substituted.
- The flag can be repeated to substitute several files at once.
- Conflicts with `--stdin-input` and `--staged`.

Under the hood, `TEMP` is added to host paths and `ORIG` is added to excludes for this run, so cross-file type inference continues to see the mutation. Reported issues and baseline entries reference `TEMP` rather than `ORIG`.

## Watch mode

`--watch` keeps the analyzer running and re-runs whenever a PHP file in the workspace is created, modified, or deleted.

```sh
mago analyze --watch
```

### Automatic restart

The analyzer also watches the files that change its own configuration:

- The loaded `mago.toml` (or whichever config Mago picked up).
- The baseline file referenced from `[analyzer].baseline`.
- `composer.json` and `composer.lock`.

When any of those change, the analyzer restarts with the reloaded configuration. So you can edit `mago.toml`, save, and the next analysis pass uses the new settings without a manual restart.

If no configuration file exists when watch mode starts, the analyzer watches for the creation of any supported config file (`mago.toml`, `mago.yaml`, `mago.json`, …) and restarts when one appears.
