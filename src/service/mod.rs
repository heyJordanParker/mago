//! Issue processing services for reporting and fixing.
//!
//! This module provides the core services for handling analysis issues in the Mago CLI.
//! It contains two main processors that work together to provide flexible issue management:
//!
//! - [`IssueProcessor`]: Core processor for reporting and fixing issues
//! - [`BaselineIssueProcessor`]: Wrapper that adds baseline functionality to issue processing
//!
//! # Issue Processing Workflow
//!
//! The issue processing workflow follows these general steps:
//!
//! 1. **Issue Collection**: Issues are gathered from linter, analyzer, or other sources
//! 2. **Baseline Filtering** (optional): Issues are filtered against a baseline file
//! 3. **Processing**: Issues are either fixed automatically or reported to the user
//! 4. **Exit Code**: Appropriate exit code is returned based on results
//!
//! # Processor Types
//!
//! ## IssueProcessor
//!
//! The core processor handles two distinct modes:
//!
//! - **Report Mode**: Formats and displays issues using configurable reporters
//! - **Fix Mode**: Applies automatic fixes with configurable safety levels
//!
//! Report mode supports multiple output formats (rich, JSON, SARIF, GitHub Actions),
//! filtering, sorting, and severity-based exit codes.
//!
//! Fix mode applies code transformations in parallel with safety checks, optional
//! formatting, and dry-run preview capabilities.
//!
//! ## BaselineIssueProcessor
//!
//! Adds baseline management capabilities on top of IssueProcessor:
//!
//! - **Baseline Loading**: Reads existing baseline files to filter known issues
//! - **Baseline Generation**: Creates new baseline files from current issues
//! - **Baseline Verification**: Validates that baseline files are up-to-date
//! - **Synchronization Checks**: Optionally fails when baseline is out of sync
//!
//! # Safety Classifications
//!
//! Automatic fixes are categorized by safety:
//!
//! - **Safe**: Always applied with `--fix`
//! - **Potentially Unsafe**: Requires `--potentially-unsafe` flag
//! - **Unsafe**: Requires `--unsafe` flag
//!
//! This graduated approach allows teams to adopt automatic fixing incrementally,
//! starting with safe fixes and progressively enabling more aggressive transformations.

/// Core issue processor for reporting and fixing analysis issues.
///
/// This processor is the main service for handling issues found during linting,
/// type analysis, or other code inspections. It supports two primary modes:
///
/// - **Report Mode** (`fix = false`): Issues are formatted and displayed using
///   the configured reporter with filtering, sorting, and severity-based exit codes.
/// - **Fix Mode** (`fix = true`): Issues with available automatic fixes are applied
///   to the source code with configurable safety levels and optional formatting.
///
/// # Lifecycle
///
/// The processor is typically created from `ReportingArgs` via the `get_processor` method
/// and consumed by calling [`process_issues`](Self::process_issues).
///
/// # Configuration
///
/// The processor's behavior is controlled by its fields, which are typically
/// populated from command-line arguments:
///
/// - Reporting options control output format, target, and filtering
/// - Fix options control safety levels, formatting, and dry-run mode
/// - Exit code behavior is determined by severity thresholds
