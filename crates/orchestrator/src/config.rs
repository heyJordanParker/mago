/// The complete configuration for the orchestrator and all its services.
///
/// This struct acts as a "meta-configuration" that aggregates all settings needed by the
/// various analysis tools (linter, formatter, analyzer, guard) along with global settings
/// that apply across all tools.
///
/// # Structure
///
/// The configuration is organized into three main categories:
///
/// 1. **Global Settings**: PHP version, progress bars
/// 2. **File Discovery**: Paths, includes, excludes, extensions
/// 3. **Tool Settings**: Linter, analyzer, guard, formatter configurations

    /// and disjunctive normal form types.

    ///
    /// These are the primary targets for linting, formatting, and analysis. If empty,
    /// the entire workspace directory will be scanned for PHP files.
    ///
    /// Supports both directory paths and glob patterns:
    /// - Directory paths: `"src"`, `"tests"` - recursively scans all files
    /// - Glob patterns: `"src/**/*.php"`, `"tests/Unit/*Test.php"` - matches specific files
    ///
    /// # Examples
    ///
    /// - `vec!["src"]` - Only analyze files in the `src` directory
    /// - `vec!["src", "tests"]` - Analyze both `src` and `tests`
    /// - `vec!["src/**/*.php"]` - Only analyze PHP files in src using glob pattern

    /// Files in this list provide context for analysis (e.g., vendor dependencies) but

    /// including third-party code that provides type information without actually checking

    ///
    /// These patterns are used to filter out files and directories that should not be
    /// processed by any tool. Patterns can use glob syntax with wildcards.
    ///
    /// # Examples
    ///
    /// - `"*.tmp"` - Exclude all temporary files
    /// - `"build/*"` - Exclude everything in the build directory
    /// - `"vendor/**"` - Exclude all vendor directories recursively
    /// - `"./cache"` - Exclude a specific directory relative to the workspace root
