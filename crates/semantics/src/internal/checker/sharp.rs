/// Checks a PHP# file against the slice: the only constructs a `.sharp` file may use, and the contract the
/// engine's lowering implements.
///
/// - At file level: `namespace`, `import`, `class`, `interface` and `enum`. A file has at most one namespace, named
///   and written without braces.
/// - A class: attributes, an optional `public`, `abstract` or `final`, a name, an optional `: Base, Interface` header,
///   constants, fields, properties and methods, with no other modifiers, `extends` or `implements`. The engine tells
///   the base class from the interfaces when it links the class.
/// - An interface: an optional `public`, a name, an optional `: Interface` header and methods, with no attributes,
///   other modifiers or `extends`. An interface method has parameters, a return type and no body, as spec section 29
///   writes `Money quote(Cart cart);`. A modifier on it is an error, because every interface method is public.
/// - An enum: attributes, an optional `public`, a name, an optional `: string, Interface` header, constants, cases and
///   methods, with no other modifiers or `implements`. A leading `int` or `string` in the header is the backing type,
///   and every class name is an interface. A constant follows a class constant's rules. A case has attributes as a
///   class has them, and is `case Active;` or, in a backed enum, `case Active = "a";`, whose value is a constant
///   expression. A case named `class`, compared ignoring case, is an error, as in PHP. A method follows a class's
///   method rules, but an enum has no constructor, so a method without a return type is an error. PHP's `check_enum`
///   reports a property and any other backing type, and the analyzer a class name in the header.
/// - A header of a class, an interface or an enum that names one type twice is an error, and so is an enum header that
///   names `UnitEnum` or `BackedEnum`, because the engine refuses both when it declares the class.
/// - Attributes: on a class, an enum, an enum case, a method, a field, a property and a parameter, written `[Name]` or
///   `[Name(arguments)]`, several in one list, as in `[Field("Name"), Searchable]`, or in several lists. An argument
///   is positional or named, and is a constant expression as a parameter default is, list and map literals included.
///   An attribute target, as in `[return: NotNull]`, is a parse error.
/// - A constant: `public`, `protected` or `private`, an optional type from the types below but `void`, one name, and a
///   value as a parameter default is.
/// - A field: `private` or `protected`, an optional `static`, a type, one name and an optional initial value. A
///   `public` field is an error, because spec section 6 has no public fields.
/// - A static field or property: an initial value that is constant, which PHP stores as its default, and a `set`
///   accessor, because PHP has no `readonly` static property.
/// - An initial value: any expression a method body has, without `this`, which is an error. A constant initial value,
///   as a parameter default is, becomes the member's default, and any other runs at the start of the constructor.
/// - A property: `public`, `protected` or `private`, an optional `static`, a type, one name, the accessors `get` and
///   an optional `set` that may take an access modifier narrower than the property's, and an optional initial value
///   after the accessors, which is a field's. A property without `get`, an accessor declared twice, or a `set` access
///   modifier as wide as the property's is an error, as in C#. A get-only property is set only where `readonly`
///   allows, and the analyzer reports every other write to it.
/// - An accessor: `get;` or `set;`, which is an auto accessor, or a body, `=> expr;` or a block, which is a method
///   body's. A body names the property's storage `field`, and a `set` body names the incoming value `value`. A
///   property has storage when an accessor is auto or a body uses `field`, and a property without storage takes no
///   initial value and is not declared by a constructor parameter, because PHP runs it as a virtual property. A `get`
///   block returns a value and a `set` block returns none, as php-src types its hooks. `field` in a lambda is an
///   error, because PHP runs a lambda as a function of its own, where `$this->name` calls the accessor again.
///   `this.name` or `this?.name` inside `name`'s own accessor is an error that names `field`, because PHP reads the
///   storage there, while C# calls the accessor again. A static property with a body is not supported yet, because
///   PHP has no hooks on a static property, and neither is a non-constant initial value on a property whose `set` has
///   a body, which would run the body in the constructor.
/// - A computed property: `public`, `protected` or `private`, a type, one name and an expression body, as in
///   `public string slug => Str.slug(name);`. Its expression is a method body's expression and runs on each read. A
///   `static` computed property is not supported yet, because PHP has no hooks on a static property.
/// - A method: `public`, `protected` or `private`, an optional `static`, `virtual` or `override`, parameters, a return
///   type and a body, or `abstract` and no body. The analyzer decides `virtual` and `override`, as spec section 22
///   writes them. Its name does not start with `__`, which PHP reserves for magic methods, and is not its class's name,
///   compared ignoring case, which PHP# gives to the constructor, nor, compared ignoring case, a property's of its
///   class.
/// - The constructor: a method named exactly after its class, without a return type and not `static`. A method
///   without a return type named otherwise is an error. A constructor parameter with an access modifier declares a
///   member: a field when `private` or `protected` without accessors, and a property with accessors, which follow the
///   auto-property rules. A `public` parameter without accessors is an error, as spec section 9 says.
/// - A parameter: always a type, a name and an optional default, and neither variadic nor by reference. A default is
///   a constant expression: a literal, a constant, `typeof(X)`, a list or map literal of them, or the operators below
///   on them, without `++` and `--`. An optional parameter before a required one is an error, because PHP would make
///   it required.
/// - Types: `int`, `float`, `bool`, `string`, a class written by its short name, `List<T>` and `Map<TKey, TValue>`
///   of these, function types `Function<R(P1, P2)>` of these, and `void` as a return type, a function type's too. A
///   `Map`'s key is `int` or `string`. PHP's own check reports a `void` parameter. Each of them is nullable when
///   written with `?` after it, as in `int?`, and PHP's own check reports `void?`.
/// - A method body: a block, or an expression body, `=> expr;`, which returns the expression, or runs it as a
///   statement in a `void` method and the constructor, as in C#.
/// - In a method body: blocks, expression statements, `return`, `let` and `const` declarations, `if` with `else if`
///   and `else`, `while`, `do … while`, `for` with a `let` or `const` counter or with expressions, `for … of` over a
///   value or a key and value, `break` and `continue` without a level, and `try` with `catch` clauses and `finally`.
///   The body of `if`, `else` and each loop is a block in braces. A catch clause names one or more classes separated
///   by `|`, and an optional variable written without `$`, which lives until the clause's block ends. A local statement can have its type written, as in `Money? total = null;` or
///   `const int base = 2;`, from the types above but `void`.
/// - Writes: `=`, compound assignment, `++` and `--` write only a local, a parameter, a member written
///   `object.name` or, when static, `Class.name`, or an index of one of them written `target[key]`. The analyzer,
///   which knows the types, allows an index write only on a `Map`, and a read not under `??` or `?.` only on a `List`,
///   as spec section 12 decides.
/// - A constant, an enum case or a static member is reached through its class name, as in `Report.count`, and the
///   engine looks up which one it is when it runs. A bare constant or static member name is an error that names the
///   class. A constant expression, which is a parameter default, an attribute argument, a constant's value, a
///   constant initial value or an enum case's value, reads only a constant or an enum case this way, as PHP does: a
///   static field or property there is an error when this file declares it, and the analyzer reports it otherwise.
/// - In expressions: literals, list literals `[a, b]`, map literals `["key": value]` and `[:]`, index reads
///   `value[key]`, templates, parentheses, bare names, assignment, the operators below, and method calls and property
///   reads written with `.` or `?.` and a member name, `new Class(...)` on a class written by its short name, calls of
///   a function by its bare name, each with positional and named arguments, `throw`, which is an expression as in PHP,
///   `typeof(X)` on a class written by its short name, without a member read or called on it, and
///   `super.method(...)`, which calls the parent's method. `?.` never follows a class. A function is the global
///   function of that name, PHP's own or one a library or the app declares, as spec sections 8 and 29 keep them, and
///   the engine calls the global one. A string literal's `\u{...}` escapes are valid codepoints, as PHP requires. A
///   `"…"` string never interpolates, and a template, `` `Order ${number}` ``, interpolates any expression of this
///   list in each `${…}` and takes JavaScript's escapes, as spec section 18 writes them.
/// - Lambdas, as spec section 3 writes them: `x => x.id`, `(a, b) => a + b` and `() => { … }`, whose body is an
///   expression or a block of a method body. A parameter is a method's, with its type optional. A lambda captures the
///   variable itself, except a loop variable that code changes, whose capture is not supported yet. A call of a local
///   by its bare name, `f(x)`, calls the lambda the local holds.
/// - Operators: `+ - * / % **`, `== != === !== < > <= >=`, `&& || !`, `??`, unary `-` and `+`, `++` and `--`, and
///   `= += -= *= /= **= ??=`.
/// - The ternary `c ? a : b` in a method body, as spec section 21 writes it. PHP's `a ?: b` is an error, and a ternary as the condition
///   of another needs parentheses, as in PHP 8.
/// - Casts: `(int)`, `(float)` and `(string)` in a method body, as spec section 24 writes them. PHP's other casts and
///   its cast aliases, such as `(bool)` and `(integer)`, are errors.
/// - A bare `Int` or `Float` before `.` is the class `Sharp\Int` or `Sharp\Float` of the engine's standard library,
///   unless the file imports the name, so `Int.parse(text)` and `Float.tryParse(text)` call it. PHP reserves both
///   names, so no file declares a class of either.
///
/// The check runs on every node the checking walk enters, and refuses any node, or any position of a node, that this
/// list does not name. It reports each refusal once, at its outermost node, and skips the nodes inside it. It does not
/// run on a file with a parse error, which is the one error to fix first. The constructs PHP# never has, such as `$`
/// variables, `global` and top-level functions, keep their own errors.
///
/// Five more refusals need inferred types or the codebase, so the analyzer makes them as its part of this contract:
/// - `+` that may join a string with any other value, which spec section 18 makes an error, in
///   `analyze_arithmetic_operation`. `+` on two strings joins them.
/// - a condition of `if`, `while`, `do … while`, `for` or `? :`, or an operand of `&&`, `||` or `!`, that is not
///   `bool`, which spec section 21 makes an error, in `Context::report_non_bool_condition`.
/// - a cast of a value that is not an `int` or a `float`, which spec section 24 makes an error, in `UnaryPrefix`'s
///   `analyze`.
/// - a call that resolves to a namespaced function, in `report_namespaced_function_call`.
/// - a full name in code, such as `App.Shared.Money.of(1)`, which spec section 23 keeps in `import` lines, in
///   `report_full_name`. One file cannot tell it from a class and its member, such as `Status.Active`.
