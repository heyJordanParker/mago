/// The PHP superglobals, which spec section 29 removes. A PHP# local or parameter of one of these names would read or

const SUPERGLOBALS: [&[u8]; 9] =
    [b"GLOBALS", b"_SERVER", b"_GET", b"_POST", b"_FILES", b"_COOKIE", b"_SESSION", b"_REQUEST", b"_ENV"];

/// How PHP# writes PHP's `mixed`. The parser reads both as `Hint::Mixed`, and only `Any` is PHP#.
const ANY: &[u8] = b"Any";

/// Checks a PHP# file against the slice: the only constructs a `.sharp` file may use, and the contract the
/// engine's lowering implements.
///
/// - At file level: `namespace`, `import`, `class`, `interface` and `enum`. A file has at most one namespace, named
///   and written without braces.
/// - A class: attributes, an optional `public`, `abstract` or `final`, a name, an optional `: Base, Interface` header,
///   constants, fields, properties, methods and operators, with no other modifiers, `extends` or `implements`. The
///   engine tells the base class from the interfaces when it links the class.
/// - A static class, `public static class Text`, as spec sections 26 and 29 write it: `static` and an optional
///   `public`, no header and no constructor, and only constants and static members. The bridge lowers it to a final
///   PHP class.
/// - An interface: an optional `public`, a name, an optional `: Interface` header and methods, with no attributes,
///   other modifiers or `extends`. An interface method has parameters, a return type and no body, as spec section 29
///   writes `Money quote(Cart cart);`. A modifier on it is an error, because every interface method is public.
/// - An enum: attributes, an optional `public`, a name, an optional `: string, Interface` header, constants, cases and
///   methods, with no other modifiers or `implements`. A leading `int` or `string` in the header is the backing type,
///   and every class name is an interface. A constant follows a class constant's rules. A case has attributes as a
///   class has them, and is `case Active;` or, in a backed enum, `case Active = "a";`, whose value is a constant
///   expression. A case named `class`, compared ignoring case, is an error, as in PHP. A method follows a class's
///   method rules, but an enum has no constructor, so a method without a return type is an error. PHP's `check_enum`
///   reports a property and any other backing type, and the analyzer a class name in the header.
/// - A header of a class, an interface or an enum that names one type twice is an error, and so is an enum header that
///   names `UnitEnum` or `BackedEnum`, because the engine refuses both when it declares the class.
/// - Attributes: on a class, an enum, an enum case, a method, a field, a property and a parameter, written `[Name]` or
///   `[Name(arguments)]`, several in one list, as in `[Field("Name"), Searchable]`, or in several lists. An argument
///   is positional or named, and is a constant expression as a parameter default is, list and map literals included.
///   PHP's own check reports a spread argument. An attribute target, as in `[return: NotNull]`, is a parse error.
/// - A constant: `public`, `protected` or `private`, an optional type from the types below but `void`, one name, and a
///   value as a parameter default is.
/// - A field: `private` or `protected`, an optional `static`, a type, one name and an optional initial value. A
///   `public` field is an error, because spec section 6 has no public fields.
/// - An override: a field written `override`, which replaces a plain PHP parent's property, spec section 6.1. It may
///   be `public`, as the parent's property is, and has a constant initial value. The analyzer checks the parent.
/// - A static field or property: an initial value that is constant, which PHP stores as its default, and a `set`
///   accessor, because PHP has no `readonly` static property.
/// - An initial value: any expression a method body has, without `this`, which is an error. A constant initial value,
///   as a parameter default is, becomes the member's default, and any other runs at the start of the constructor.
/// - A property: `public`, `protected` or `private`, an optional `static`, a type, one name, the accessors `get` and
///   an optional `set` that may take an access modifier narrower than the property's, and an optional initial value
///   after the accessors, which is a field's. A property without `get`, an accessor declared twice, or a `set` access
///   modifier as wide as the property's is an error, as in C#. A get-only property is set only where `readonly`
///   allows, and the analyzer reports every other write to it.
/// - An accessor: `get;` or `set;`, which is an auto accessor, or a body, `=> expr;` or a block, which is a method
///   body's. A body names the property's storage `field`, and a `set` body names the incoming value `value`. A
///   property has storage when an accessor is auto or a body uses `field`, and a property without storage takes no
///   initial value and is not declared by a constructor parameter, because PHP runs it as a virtual property. A `get`
///   block returns a value and a `set` block returns none, as php-src types its hooks. `field` in a lambda is an
///   error, because PHP runs a lambda as a function of its own, where `$this->name` calls the accessor again.
///   `this.name` or `this?.name` inside `name`'s own accessor is an error that names `field`, because PHP reads the
///   storage there, while C# calls the accessor again. A static property with a body is not supported yet, because
///   PHP has no hooks on a static property, and neither is a non-constant initial value on a property whose `set` has
///   a body, which would run the body in the constructor.
/// - A computed property: `public`, `protected` or `private`, a type, one name and an expression body, as in
///   `public string slug => Str.slug(name);`. Its expression is a method body's expression and runs on each read. A
///   `static` computed property is not supported yet, because PHP has no hooks on a static property.
/// - A method: `public`, `protected` or `private`, an optional `static`, `virtual` or `override`, parameters, a return
///   type and a body, or `abstract` and no body. The analyzer decides `virtual` and `override`, as spec section 22
///   writes them. Its name does not start with `__`, which PHP reserves for magic methods, and is not its class's name,
///   compared ignoring case, which PHP# gives to the constructor, nor, compared ignoring case, a property's of its
///   class.
/// - An operator, as spec section 19 writes `public static Money operator +(Money a, Money b) => …;`: `public static`,
///   a return type, `operator`, one of `+ - * / % **`, unary `-`, `==` and `<=>`, parameters and a method body.
///   `!=` derives from `==`, and `< > <= >=` from `<=>`, so declaring one is an error that names its source. `==`,
///   `<=>` and the binary arithmetic operators take two parameters, unary `-` one, and one of them is the declaring
///   class. `==` returns `bool`, and `<=>` `int`. A class declares each operator once, because each runs as one
///   static method named after .NET's, such as `op_Addition`. An interface or an enum declares no operator.
/// - An `extern` method, `public static extern string slug(string title);`, whose body is native, compiled into the
///   engine, as spec section 29 writes it: a `public static` method of a static class, with no body. Only the
///   standard library declares one, and the analyzer refuses one anywhere else.
/// - The constructor: a method named exactly after its class, without a return type and not `static`. A method
///   without a return type named otherwise is an error. A constructor parameter with an access modifier declares a
///   member: a field when `private` or `protected` without accessors, and a property with accessors, which follow the
///   auto-property rules. A `public` parameter without accessors is an error, as spec section 9 says. The constructor
///   alone may be `required`, which keeps it callable as `new Self(…)` on every subclass, spec section 25. The parser
///   reports `required` on any other member as not supported yet.
/// - A parameter: always a type, a name and an optional default, and never by reference. A default is a constant
///   expression: a literal, a constant, `typeof(X)`, a list or map literal of them, or the operators below on them,
///   without `++` and `--`. A parameter written `int ...values` is variadic, as spec section 7 writes it, and PHP's
///   own checks report a variadic parameter that is not the last or has a default. `check_parameter_list` reports a
///   variadic parameter that declares a member or has a `void` type in a `.sharp` file only, as upstream Mago reports
///   neither. An optional parameter before a required one is an error, because PHP would make it required. A
///   variadic parameter is not a required one, as in PHP. A default of `Position.current()` of the standard library is
///   not supported yet, because as a default it gives the caller's position, spec section 27, which waits for typed
///   compilation.
/// - Types: `int`, `float`, `bool`, `string`, `Any`, a class written by its short name, `List<T>` and
///   `Map<TKey, TValue>` of these, function types `Function<R(P1, P2)>` of these, and `void` as a return type, a
///   function type's too. A `Map`'s key is `int` or `string`. PHP's own check reports a `void` parameter and a `void`
///   field. Each of them is nullable when written with `?` after it, as in `int?` or `Map<string, Any?>`, and PHP's
///   own check reports `void?`. PHP's `mixed` is an error, because spec section 24 writes it `Any?`. A union of them but
///   `void`, written inline as spec section 24 writes it, as in `int|string` or `List<int>|string`, goes wherever a
///   type goes. PHP's own check reports `void` and a nullable type, as in `int?|string`, in a union, and
///   `check_union` reports a type written twice, which the engine refuses. A union holds null only when written in
///   parentheses with `?` after it, as in `(int|string)?`, which the engine compiles as `int|string|null`.
///   `check_union` reports `null` written in a union, as in `int|null`, as not supported yet. PHP's own check reports
///   a nullable union inside another union, and a single type in parentheses, as in `(Calc)?`, which PHP# writes
///   `Calc?`. `(int)?` is a parse error, as PHP lexes `(int)` as a cast. A field, or a property with storage and `set`,
///   of a nullable type or a nullable union starts as null without an initial value, as in C# and Swift, so
///   `private int? total;` holds null until it is written, and the engine gives it the default `null`. A get-only
///   property with storage of one without an initial value is not supported yet, because it is set only where
///   `readonly` allows, and `readonly` takes no default. A property without storage holds nothing to start with.
/// - `Self`, written exactly so, is the class a static method is called on, spec section 25, and PHP's `static`. It is
///   a method's return type only, as in Swift, nullable as in `Self?`, in a union as in `Self|int`, or a type argument
///   there as in `List<Self>`, and any other type position, a function type's included, is an error. The lexer reads
///   `Self` and `self` as one keyword, and every other spelling is PHP's `self`, which PHP# removes: `self` and
///   `static`, as a type or in an expression, are errors that name the class, the enum or `Self`.
/// - A method body: a block, or an expression body, `=> expr;`, which returns the expression, or runs it as a
///   statement in a `void` method and the constructor, as in C#.
/// - In a method body: blocks, expression statements, `return`, `let` and `const` declarations, `if` with `else if`
///   and `else`, `while`, `do … while`, `for` with a `let` or `const` counter or with expressions, `for … of` over a
///   value or a key and value, `break` and `continue` without a level, and `try` with `catch` clauses and `finally`.
///   The body of `if`, `else` and each loop is a block in braces. A catch clause names one or more classes separated
///   by `|`, and an optional variable written without `$`, which lives until the clause's block ends. A local
///   statement can have its type written, as in `Money? total = null;` or `const int base = 2;`, from the types
///   above but `void`. An expression statement whose operator is binary, as in `flags | MASK;`, is an error that
///   names its compound assignment or its result, because the result is never used, except `??` and an assignment
///   that PHP's `and`, `or` and `xor` bind looser than.
/// - Writes: `=`, compound assignment, `++` and `--` write only a local, a parameter, a member written
///   `object.name` or, when static, `Class.name`, or an index of one of them written `target[key]`. The analyzer,
///   which knows the types, allows an index write only on a `Map`, and a read not under `??` or `?.` only on a `List`,
///   as spec section 12 decides.
/// - A constant, an enum case or a static member is reached through its class name, as in `Report.count`, and the
///   engine looks up which one it is when it runs. A bare constant or static member name is an error that names the
///   class. A constant expression, which is a parameter default, an attribute argument, a constant's value, a
///   constant initial value or an enum case's value, reads only a constant or an enum case this way, as PHP does: a
///   static field or property there is an error when this file declares it, and the analyzer reports it otherwise.
/// - In expressions: literals, list literals `[a, b]` and `[...a, b]`, map literals `["key": value]` and `[:]`, index reads
///   `value[key]`, templates, parentheses, bare names, assignment, the operators below, and method calls and property
///   reads written with `.` or `?.` and a member name, `new Class(...)` on a class written by its short name,
///   `new Self(...)` in a class whose constructor is `required`, calls of a function by its bare name,
///   `super.method(...)`, which calls the parent's method, and `Self.method(...)`, which calls a static method of the
///   class a static method is called on, each with positional, named and spread arguments, as in
///   `Money.sum(...prices)` and `max(...prices)`, `throw`, which is an expression as in PHP, `exit(code)` and
///   `exit()`, which spec section 8 keeps as PHP 8.4's built-in function, and `typeof(X)` on a class written by its
///   short name, without a member read or called on it. `new Self(...)` in an enum is an error, because an enum has
///   no constructor. `Self.name` read or written is not supported yet, as `super.name` is not. PHP's own check
///   reports a positional argument after a spread and a spread after a named argument, and `check_function_call`
///   reports `assert` with a spread as its only argument, after which PHP adds a positional description. `?.` never
///   follows a class. A function is the global function of that name, PHP's own or one a library or the app
///   declares, as spec sections 8 and 29 keep them, and the engine calls the global one. A string literal's `\u{...}`
///   escapes are valid codepoints, as PHP requires. A `"…"` string never interpolates, and a template,
///   `` `Order ${number}` ``, interpolates any expression of this list in each `${…}` and takes JavaScript's escapes,
///   as spec section 18 writes them.
/// - Lambdas, as spec section 3 writes them: `x => x.id`, `(a, b) => a + b` and `() => { … }`, whose body is an
///   expression or a block of a method body. A parameter is a method's, with its type optional, so the last one can
///   be variadic, as in `(int ...values) => count(values)`. A lambda captures the variable itself, except a loop
///   variable that code changes, whose capture is not supported yet. A call of a local by its bare name, `f(x)`,
///   calls the lambda the local holds, with positional, named and spread arguments.
/// - Operators: `+ - * / % **`, `== != === !== < > <= >=`, `&& || !`, `??`, unary `-` and `+`, `++` and `--`, and
///   `= += -= *= /= **= ??=`. Spec section 19 puts `<`, `<=`, `>`, `>=`, `is` and `as` in one row and `==`, `!=`,
///   `===` and `<=>` in the next, and an operator of either row that takes an operand of its own row without
///   parentheses, as in `a < b < c` or `a is T is U`, is an error that names the groupings to write. So is a comparison
///   in the value of a comparison or value pattern, as in `x is > a < b`.
/// - `@`, which hides PHP's warnings, in a method body of a file whose namespace is `Sharp` or below it, where the
///   standard library writes it before a method throws its own exception. Anywhere else it is an error, and the
///   analyzer refuses it in any file that is not the standard library's.
/// - The ternary `c ? a : b` in a method body, as spec section 21 writes it. PHP's `a ?: b` is an error, and a
///   ternary as the condition of another needs parentheses, as in PHP 8.
/// - Pattern matching in a method body, as spec section 21 writes it: `x is pattern`, `x as T` to a type that is not
///   nullable or `void`, and `match`, whose arms are `pattern => value`, `pattern when condition => value` and one
///   `default => value`. A `match` needs `default` unless its arms name only `Class.y` values or `null`, as a `match`
///   on an enum does, and the analyzer reports the cases such a `match` misses. A `match` statement's arm may be a
///   block. A pattern is a type with an optional name, as in `int count`, a value, a comparison such as `< 10`, a
///   properties pattern such as `{ total: > 0 }`, or patterns joined by `and`, `or` and `not`. A type pattern is never
///   nullable, and a name under `or` or `not` is an error, as C#'s CS8780, except under the `not` that starts the
///   pattern of `is`. `not` beside `or` is an error that names both readings, as decision 045 decides, and `!x is T`,
///   which reads as `(!x) is T`, is an error that writes `x is not T`, as decision 044 decides. The parser reports list
///   patterns, and enum case patterns with fields or a name, as not supported yet.
/// - Casts: `(int)`, `(float)` and `(string)` in a method body, as spec section 24 writes them. PHP's other casts and
///   its cast aliases, such as `(bool)` and `(integer)`, are errors. A cast is lowercase only, so the lexer reads
///   `(Int)` as the class `Int` in parentheses, as in `typeof(Int)`.
/// - A bare `Int`, `Float`, `Bool`, `Position`, `Environment`, `List` or `Replaces` names the class `Sharp\<Name>` of
///   the standard library wherever a class is named, unless the file imports or declares a class-like of that name,
///   spec section 23. So `Int.parse(text)`, `Bool.tryParse(value)`, `Position.current()`, `new Environment()` and
///   `List.wrap(value)` call it, and `[Replaces("date")]` is its attribute. PHP reserves `Int`, `Float`, `Bool` and
///   `List`, so no file declares or imports a class of those, except the standard library's own `Sharp.Int`,
///   `Sharp.Float` and `Sharp.Bool`: a file whose namespace is exactly `Sharp` declares them, as the engine allows,
///   and any file may import them.
///
/// The check runs on every node the checking walk enters, and refuses any node, or any position of a node, that this
/// list does not name. It reports each refusal once, at its outermost node, and skips the nodes inside the refusal's
/// span. A node refused at a part, such as a method at its name or a cast at its operator, keeps its other parts
/// checked, so every PHP form PHP# removes is refused by name wherever it is written. It does not run on a file with a
/// parse error, which is the one error to fix first. The constructs PHP# never has, such as `$`
/// variables, `global` and top-level functions, keep their own errors. So do the PHP forms PHP# removes, each an error
/// that names its replacement. In a method body, they are `echo`, `print`, `die`, and `exit` without parentheses or
/// with a string literal or a template as its first argument. In a method body and a constant expression, they are
/// superglobals, read or written, magic constants and other `__Something__` names, `(array)` and `(object)`. A
/// `__Something__` name is an error when it is declared too, as a class, interface, enum, enum case, method, property,
/// constant, parameter or local. A method name that starts but does not end with `__`, as PHP's magic methods do,
/// stays not supported yet.
///
/// Nineteen more refusals need inferred types or the codebase, so the analyzer makes them as its part of this contract:
/// - `new` on a static class, in `analyze_class_instantiation`, and a class that extends one, in
///   `check_class_like_extends`, because the static class may be another file's.
/// - an `extern` method anywhere but a standard library file whose class is under `Sharp`, in `Method`'s `analyze`,
///   `@` in any file that is not the standard library's, in `UnaryPrefix`'s `analyze`, and a class or enum named
///   `Sharp.Int`, `Sharp.Float` or `Sharp.Bool` in any file that is not the standard library's, in
///   `report_sharp_type_class_outside_library`, because only the analyzer knows the file's package. The nearest
///   `composer.json` above a file names it.
/// - a bare call that finds no function while the enclosing class declares a method of that name, in
///   `bare_member_call`, because only the codebase knows which functions exist. A bare call is the global function's.
/// - `+` that may join a string with any other value, which spec section 18 makes an error, in
///   `analyze_arithmetic_operation`. `+` on two strings joins them.
/// - a condition of `if`, `while`, `do … while`, `for` or `? :`, or an operand of `&&`, `||` or `!`, that is not
///   `bool`, which spec section 21 makes an error, in `Context::report_non_bool_condition`.
/// - a cast of a value that is not an `int` or a `float`, which spec section 24 makes an error, in `UnaryPrefix`'s
///   `analyze`.
/// - an `exit` argument that is not an `int`, which spec section 8 makes an error, in `ExitConstruct`'s `analyze`.
///   `check_slice` refuses a string literal or template argument, because the engine runs `.sharp` files without the
///   analyzer.
/// - a call that resolves to a namespaced function, in `report_namespaced_function_call`.
/// - a spread of a value that is not a list, which spec section 7 spreads, in `report_non_list_spread`.
/// - a named argument that names a variadic parameter or no parameter, on a method or a plain PHP function that
///   takes any number of arguments too, which spec section 16 makes an error, in `analyze_invocation`.
/// - a default or an initial value that does not fit its declared type, such as `null` for an `int` or `false` for
///   an `int|string`, which the engine refuses, in `check_parameter_default_value` and the property's
///   `analyze_default_value`. A nullable type, as in `int? total = null`, holds `null`.
/// - a constructor of any descendant of a class whose constructor is `required` that changes its parent
///   constructor's parameters or adds one without a default, which spec section 25 makes an error, in
///   `validate_method_signature_compatibility`, as PHP's `@consistent-constructor` does for a child.
/// - an override of a method with a variadic parameter that is not variadic, which spec section 7 makes an error and
///   the engine refuses, in `validate_method_signature_compatibility`.
/// - a full name in code, such as `App.Shared.Money.of(1)`, which spec section 23 keeps in `import` lines, in
///   `report_full_name`. One file cannot tell it from a class and its member, such as `Status.Active`.
/// - an `operator ==` in a class that neither declares nor inherits a `public int hash()`, in `Operator`'s `analyze`,
///   because the parent may be another file's.
/// - an operator a parent already declares, in `check_inherited_operators`, because the parent may be another file's.
